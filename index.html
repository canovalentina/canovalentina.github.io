          <br> 
          This paper aims to examine several narratives that have perpetuated the denial of racism throughout Venezuelan history, analyze the impact of President Hugo Chávez's discourse and policy implementation in regards to racial inequality, and emphasize the importance of addressing the topic of race in Venezuela. This research was conducted as my final Capstone project for the International Development Studies major at Brown.

          Hunger levels in Venezuela have skyrocketed in recent years. With this crisis, the government has created systems to provide food to those in need. This paper analyzes the CLAP system, arguing that it is a form of political clientelism and manipulation between the Maduro government and the most vulnerable population of Venezuela.

          <a href="docs/AnthropologyGoodsValentinaCano.pdf">Commodification of Nature and Society, Identity, and the Multidimensionality of the Anthropology of the Good</a>
          <br>How do anthropologists study the "good" and how is it enmeshed in social, political and material processes? This paper uses three ethnographies to illustrate how anthropology teaches us to "think constellationally" and how the commodification of nature and people play an important role in the understanding of goods.

            <a href="docs/SociologyOfDevelopmentValentinaCano.pdf">Good Governance, International Aid, and its Implications for Development </a>
              <br>By exploring different points of view in regards to the question of international aid in developing countries, and using Chile as a case study, this paper argues that democratic accountability and good governance are essential for development; therefore, international aid should be focused on building state capacities.

          <p> <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/brown.edu/venezuela-cano-valentina/analysis">Venezuela Case Study Data Analysis</a>

          <a href="docs/RawlsianJusticeVenezuelaValentinaCano.pdf"> Socialism of the 21st century: An Analysis of Rawlsian Justice and Freedom in Venezuela</a> 
            <br>In 1999, Hugo Chávez became president of Venezuela and implemented a new political system called "Socialism of the 21st century" which, in theory, seems to be consistent with John Rawls' definition of justice and freedom. This paper argues that in practice, this political model fails to achieve true justice in the economic, political, and social realms.
