          >Historical Narratives of Denial of Racism and the Impact of Hugo
          Chávez on Racial Discourse in Venezuela
        </a>
      </h4>
      <p>
        This paper aims to examine several narratives that have perpetuated the
        denial of racism throughout Venezuelan history, analyze the impact of
        President Hugo Chávez's discourse and policy implementation in regards
        to racial inequality, and emphasize the importance of addressing the
        topic of race in Venezuela. This research was conducted as my final
        Capstone project for the International Development Studies major at
        Brown.

      </h4>
      <p>
        Hunger levels in Venezuela have skyrocketed in recent years. With this
        crisis, the government has created systems to provide food to those in
        need. This paper analyzes the CLAP system, arguing that it is a form of
        political clientelism and manipulation between the Maduro government and
        the most vulnerable population of Venezuela.

      </h4>
      <p>
        This paper explores the ways in which Carolina Hick's illustrations and
        personal experiences fall into the project of Third World Feminism,
        through Gloria Anzaldúa's concept of nepantla, Audre Lorde's analysis of
        the erotic, and Juana María Rodríguez's notions of queer latinidad.

      <p>
        In this paper I examine the work of Guatemalan artist Regina José
        Galindo, in conversation with the definition of feminicide that Rosa
        Linda Fregoso and Cynthia Bejarano present in A Cartography of
        Feminicide in the Américas.

      <p>
        How is classism and racism intertwined in Latin America? Is Latin
        America "café con leche" or "café y leche"? How does reggaetón represent
        Blackness? This paper seeks to provide an overview of Afro Latinidad
        from the lens of history and music.

          >Good Governance, International Aid, and its Implications for
          Development
        </a>
      </h4>
      <p>
        By exploring different points of view in regards to the question of
        international aid in developing countries, and using Chile as a case
        study, this paper argues that democratic accountability and good
        governance are essential for development; therefore, international aid
        should be focused on building state capacities.

      </h4>
      <p>
        How do anthropologists study the "good" and how is it enmeshed in
        social, political and material processes? This paper uses three
        ethnographies to illustrate how anthropology teaches us to "think
        constellationally" and how the commodification of nature and people play
        an important role in the understanding of goods.

      <p>
        This paper explores whether or not there exists a monolithic
        conceptualization of Afro Latin America in history and society using
        multiple academic texts in conversation with the Venezuelan novel
        Cumboto.

      </h4>
      <p>
        Using the examples of the human rights and environmentalist movements,
        this paper explains how contemporary globalization has brought a
        weakening of institutional accountability which generates
        countermovements to express social and political inconformity.

          Socialism of the 21st century: An Analysis of Rawlsian Justice and
          Freedom in Venezuela</a
        >
      </h4>
      <p>
        In 1999, Hugo Chávez became president of Venezuela and implemented a new
        political system called "Socialism of the 21st century" which, in
        theory, seems to be consistent with John Rawls' definition of justice
        and freedom. This paper argues that in practice, this political model
        fails to achieve true justice in the economic, political, and social
        realms.
